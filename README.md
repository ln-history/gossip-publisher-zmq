# ⚡ Gossip Publisher ZMQ
A Core Lightning plugin that **monitors your node's gossip store and broadcasts network events in real-time via ZeroMQ**!
It is a part of the [ln-history project](https://github.com/ln-history)

## Lightning Network Gossip

### 🔍 What is this?
This plugin acts as a bridge between your Core Lightning node and any application that wants to consume Lightning Network gossip data. It continuously monitors the gossip_store file, parses every gossip message into a human-readable format, and broadcasts the gossip data in its raw and parsed form through a ZeroMQ publisher socket.

## 🚀 Features
   - 🔄 Real-time monitoring of the gossip store
   - 🧩 Parses all Lightning Network gossip message types
   - 📡 Publishes structured data via ZeroMQ
   - 🔌 Easy integration with any programming language supporting ZMQ
   - 🧠 Uses the [lnhistoryclient](https://pypi.org/project/lnhistoryclient/) library for accurate message parsing

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
   - [Core Lightning node](https://corelightning.org/)
   - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
   - [ZeroMQ library](https://zeromq.org/)

### Install the plugin

### Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ln-history/gossip-publisher-zmq.git
cd gossip-publisher-zmq
```

### Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Correcting the shebang
On top of the [main.py](main.py) file there is a line starting with `#!`.
This should be an absolute path pointing to the virual environment just created.

Put in this as the first line: `#!/home/<your-user>/path/to/plugin/gossip-publisher-zmq/.venv/bin/python`

## 🎮 Usage
### Configure the plugin
Create a .env file (feel free to copy the .example.env file) with your configuration settings:
```sh
ZMQ_HOST=127.0.0.1
ZMQ_PORT=5675

DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL=1
DEFAULT_SENDER_NODE_ID=my-gossip-publisher-zmq      # Set a name or id for your node that gets attached to every published message

DEFAULT_LOG_DIR=logs
```

#### Start the plugin with Core Lightning

Add to your lightning configuration
```sh
echo "plugin=/path/to/gossip-publisher-zmq/main.py" >> ~/.lightning/config
```

Or start it directly with lightningd
```sh
lightningd --plugin=/path/to/gossip-publisher-zmq/main.py
```

In case you want to configure the env variables, you can also pass them as <key>=<value>, using this syntax:
```sh
lightning-cli -k plugin subcommand=start plugin=/path/to/plugin/gossip-publisher-zmq/main.py zmq-port=5676
```

Check plugin status
```sh
lightning-cli gpz-status
```

## 📊 Message Format
Each message published by the plugin follows a JSON structure. For example a `channel_announcement`, looks like this:

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "type": 256,
        "name": "channel_announcement",
        "timestamp": 1686923456,
        "sender_node_id": "03a...b2c",
        "length": 414
    },
    "raw_hex": "0102...",
    "parsed": {
        "channel_id": "631...ab9",
        "node1_id": "02d...f4c",
        "node2_id": "03a...e7b",
        "bitcoin_key1": "02e...a4d",
        "bitcoin_key2": "03f...c7e",
        "chain_hash": "06...ee",
        "scid": "103x2x1"
    }
}
```

The library [lnhistoryclient](https://pypi.org/project/lnhistoryclient/) provides python classes, types, functions and much more for the gossip messages.


## 🧙‍♂️ Subscribing to messages
You can subscribe to gossip messages in any language with ZeroMQ support:

This repository provides a simple python [example](./subscriber.py), to see the results of this plugin.

```python
import zmq
import json

context = zmq.Context()
socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5675")

# Subscribe to all messages
socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "")
# Or specific message types
# socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "channel_announcement")

while True:
    topic = socket.recv_string()
    message = socket.recv_string()
    data = json.loads(message)
    print(f"Received {topic}: {data}")
```

## 💬 Message Types
The plugin handles all types of Lightning Network gossip messages:

📢 channel_announcement - Announces new channels
👤 node_announcement - Broadcasts node information and features
🔄 channel_update - Updates channel routing policies
